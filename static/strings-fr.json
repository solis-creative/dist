        "text": "Based in London, ARROE was founded in 2016 by Eoin Cooney and Romain Pascal who previously worked together on the smart luggage brand SLAINT. After successfully bringing multiple products to market they realised that the technology required to make the perfect product didn't exist yet. So they decided to make their own and ARROE was born to develop technology that allows people to harness and store energy on an individual level to charge personal devices, wearables and smart clothing.",
